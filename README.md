## Introduction

The Basic Calculator is a console application designed for performing basic arithmetic operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input two numbers and select an operation, with support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Functionalities

1. **User Input**
   - Users can input two numbers and select an operation.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

3. **Error Handling**
   - The program handles invalid inputs and notifies users of any mistakes.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Use a C# compiler to compile the program.

2. **Run the Executable:**
   - Execute the compiled program.

3. **Perform Calculations:**
   - Follow on-screen instructions to input numbers and select an operation.

## Examples

### Addition

```plaintext
Input_1: 5
Operator: +
Input_2: 3
5 + 3 = 8
Re-run Calculator? (input 1 or 2):
1. YES
2. Quit? 1
```
### Subtraction

```plaintext
Input_1: 5
Operator: -
Input_2: 3
5 - 3 = 2
Re-run Calculator? (input 1 or 2):
1. YES
2. Quit? 1
```
### Multiplication

```plaintext
Input_1: 5
Operator: *
Input_2: 3
5 * 3 = 15
Re-run Calculator? (input 1 or 2):
1. YES
2. Quit?1
```
## Division

```plaintext
Input_1: 15
Operator: /
Input_2: 0
Division by zero
15 / 3 = infinity
Re-run Calculator? (input 1 or 2):
1. YES
2. Quit?1
```
